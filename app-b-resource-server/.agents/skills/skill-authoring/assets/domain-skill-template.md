Example template of a BUSINESS (domain) skill.
Copy it to `.agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`, remove these comments and replace the
`<...>` placeholders. Document only what the sources support; an unknown value or a
divergence with no decision is a question to escalate to the human, never an invented
value. The content language follows the project's artifact convention.
